### Purpose
This library has been written in order to ease the conversion between GNSS data formats. Its use will be first and foremost as a submodule in projects that will require these kind of different geopositioning representations.

### Installation
**make** and a **C++11** compatible compiler are required. Clone the repo and type ``make``, it should be enough in most cases to build the two executables!   
There's also a **VS2015** solution avalaible.
